            <p>An interactive role playing tool which equips the player with accurate information and insights on mental wellness. The user can explore various regions given in a map where each region deals with a different issue. Each region offers experiences of other people who have gone through the same. The objective is to give the user a platform to share, relate, empathize and learn from other people's experiences. The integration of gamification through levelling up and the gym battle (boss battle) feature rekindles the player's desire to learn.</p>

             <h1>Inspiration</h1>
             <p>The concept of "mental health" is not significant in our world today. Our inspiration germinated due to the lack of awareness on the same. When all of us were stuck at home owing to the global pandemic, we realised how difficult it is to be away from our close ones. The fact that people could be facing a similar situation got us thinking. Implementing gamification into mental health would be a unique and effective mode of spreading awareness among people of all age groups. As ardent Pokémon fans, we envisioned this project bearing the popular Pokémon titles in mind. Being a massive hit among children and adults alike, a Pokémon themed gamification model will enable the players to be “The Very Best” version of themselves.</p>

            <h1>Chat App</h1>
            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>The Chat App is used to collect data from various students (in this case, their personal experiences) which is then used in the "Liira" app as gamified learning material.
              Liira uses this information in multiple instances:

              <ul>
                  <li>Grass encounters utilize small snippets of the users experience or quotes.</li>
                  <li>Trainers use past experiences of alumni to show how they got past their hurdles.</li>
                  <li>Set up one-on-one counselling sessions between a student and a professional (Future development).</li>
                </ul>
                The chat App implements private rooms to ensure secure and uninteruppted meetings between friends or counsellors.
The username is set by the student and can be used to ensure anonymity of the participant if they so desire.
