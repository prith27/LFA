                  <h1>What is mental health?</h1>
                  <p>Mental health includes our emotional, psychological, and social well-being. It affects how we think, feel, and act. It also helps determine how we handle stress, relate to others, and make choices. Mental health is important at every stage of life, from childhood and adolescence through adulthood.

                    Over the course of your life, if you experience mental health problems, your thinking, mood, and behavior could be affected. Many factors contribute to mental health problems, including:
                    <ul>
                    <li>Biological factors, such as genes or brain </li>
                    <li>Life experiences, such as trauma or abuse</li>
                    <li>Family history of mental health </li></ul>

                  <h1>Mental Health Wellness</h1>
                  <p style="margin-bottom: 100px;">Mental health wellness is a key component in establishing and maintaining a healthy lifestyle. Mental health wellness is just as important as physical and medical health, so it is important to learn strategies to maintain good mental health.

                    The definition of mental wellness is the awareness of one’s own ability to cope with stressors of day-to-day life while maintaining the ability to function effectively when socializing, working, learning and taking care of personal health and hygiene. A person that fits the definition of mental wellness has a positive sense of wellbeing and hope, despite daily stressors and challenges. Overall, mental health wellness depends on factors, like self-acceptance, autonomy, quality of relationships, capacity for personal growth, and overall life satisfaction.
                </p>
                <h1>Why is being 'mentally healthy' important?</h1>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 100px;">Mental health wellness is an important part of personal balance because it affects other areas of life, such as physical wellness, emotional wellness, financial wellness and spiritual wellness. For example, a person with good mental wellness who is suffering from a physical illness has a higher rate of recovery and a smaller risk of that illness from becoming critical or fatal than someone who has poor mental wellness. This is because mental wellness provides people with the ability to cope with and work through stress, frustrations, and even exhaustion, so these factors do not cause stress on the body.

                    Another example of how mental health wellness affects overall wellness is without mental health wellness there cannot be emotional wellness. A sound mind strengthens emotional regulation and balance, which promotes positive and healthy relationships, along with strong performance skills that promote financial stability.
